# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository originally had the starter code for the project: I forked and cloned this repository, then build upon it to practice my HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills. I finished off by making it accessible for desktop, tablet, and mobile, using responsive design concepts.
